# Even Numbers Generator
# Objective
  # Practice filtering logic within a generator.
  # Reinforce the idea of yielding only certain values (in this case, even numbers).
# Task
  # Write a generator function even_numbers(nums) that takes a list (or any iterable) of integers and yields only those that are even.
  # Test it on a small list of mixed even/odd integers.
  # Print each yielded value to confirm itâ€™s even.
